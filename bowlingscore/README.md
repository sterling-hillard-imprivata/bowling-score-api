## Overview
This API uses the Django Rest Framework feature to replicate a Bowling scoring application. This project was inspired by the Software Engineering and Hiring teams at Zebra. 

Project Specs:
"The challenge is to implement a bowling scoring REST API (and optional front end). Basically, something that takes in pins knocked down for players and keeps track of them and calculates and provides their scores.
"
Used this as reference:

- If you were in a bowling alley and looked at the display, it would be the service that powered the numbers behind the display.
- Use production-quality code that's well-tested and well-documented. 
- Show usage of a REST framework
- Any modern language is permissable so I will use Python. 
- The solution should score as the game progresses rather than just at the end.
